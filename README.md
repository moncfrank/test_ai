# GreenGuide AI

## Summary

GreenGuide AI is a personal assistant that helps individuals and businesses reduce their carbon footprint by analyzing their consumption patterns and providing concrete, customized tips for daily life.

## Background

Problem:
Many people want to reduce their environmental impact but don't know exactly how. Information is available, but it is often general and difficult to translate into concrete actions.

How common:
This is a global and growing problem. Interest in sustainability is increasing every year, but the gap between intention and action remains significant.

Personal motivation:
I care deeply about climate issues, but from personal experience, I know how difficult it can be to figure out what actually makes a difference. I want to make it easier for people to act correctly.

Why it matters:
If more people can get simple, personalized advice, we can reduce emissions on a broad scale. Small changes in many people’s behavior can have a huge impact.




## How is it used?

Users:
Individuals who want to live more sustainably, and small businesses that want to brand themselves as environmentally friendly.

Usage context:
A mobile app or a web service.
The user receives a weekly report and small daily suggestions, for example:
"Replace one meat-based meal per week with a vegetarian alternative and save 10 kg of CO₂ per month."

Impact:
On users themselves, their local environment, and in the long term, society and the climate.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources:

Users' own consumption data (voluntarily shared, e.g., purchases, travel, electricity use)

Open climate databases (e.g., DEFRA emission factors)

Life cycle analyses of products (e.g., Ecoinvent)

AI techniques:

Supervised machine learning: To predict environmental impact based on user habits.

Recommendation systems: To suggest personalized actions.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): To allow users to freely ask questions through a chatbot.

(Demo idea):
An initial version could use a simple regression model to predict CO₂ emissions based on purchasing data.

## Challenges

Limitations:

Gathering accurate user data can be difficult (privacy, willingness to share).

Not all actions can be quantified precisely.

Users' motivation levels vary, and some suggestions might be ignored.

## What next?

Future development:

Integrate with payment apps and receipt-scanning apps for automatic data collection.

Adapt communication style based on user behavior (e.g., more or fewer reminders depending on personality).

Introduce a "Green Score" feature that could be shared on job applications, social networks, etc. (with user consent).
